# Wosaic
This is an upgraded and maven-enabled fork of the Wosaic photo mosaic software based on java source https://code.google.com/p/wosaic/

Ensure you create a properties file with your Flickr keys for your current maven profile, ie. for 'dev' profile, 
    
    profiles/dev/config.properties

This file should contain your Flickr keys.  e.g., 
    
    flickr.apikey=(your key goes here)
    flickr.secret=(your app secret goes here)
    facebook.apikey=(etc..)
